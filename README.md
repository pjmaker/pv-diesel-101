# pv-diesel-101

Introduction to PV/Diesel hybrid power systems.

The intent is to make a shared course for at least two 
targets:

* Alaska Wind Diesel Integration
* Powerwater internal training

The main question is as usual are:

* Who is going to write it
* What are the critical questions

I'm quite keen on getting the appropriate input
from a few different sources (e.g. Malaysia, WA, Alaska. Korea).

So if you could be so kind, I'd like
to ask what the critical questions are, who
might want to use such a course, whats the audience etc.
For all this I suggest the wiki page where I've added pages
for various places/organisations.

The talk itself will be a PDF file generated by LaTeX but if
LaTeX scares you fine, just use the wiki and I'll edit it.

Final note: this is an experiment in cooperative course/presentation
writing, and I'll be interested to see how it goes.
