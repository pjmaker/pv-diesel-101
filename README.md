# pv-diesel-101

Introduction to PV/Diesel hybrid power systems.

The intent is to make a shared course for at least two 
targets:

* Alaska Wind Diesel Integration
* Powerwater internal training

The main question is as usual are:

* Who is going to write it
* What are the critical questions

I'm quite keen on getting the appropriate input
from a few different sources (e.g. Malaysia, WA, Alaska. Korea).

So if you could be so kind, I'd like
to ask what the critical questions are, who
might want to use such a course, whats the audience etc.
For all this I suggest the wiki page where I've added pages
for various places/organisations.

The talk itself will be a PDF file generated by LaTeX but if
LaTeX scares you fine, just use the wiki and I'll edit it.
Another option is to send me talks which I'll archive here 
in talks/ and use there contents (with your kind permission of course)
to make the presentations. Beyond the pv-diesel-101 I think we
may need an overview talk and other things but perhaps we keep them
in this boxen for now.

Final note: this is an experiment in cooperative course/presentation
writing, and I'll be interested to see how it goes.
