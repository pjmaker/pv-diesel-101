  \begin{itemize}
  \item Running a bigger diesel costs more than running a little one.
  \item The power station keeps a big enough diesel running to handle
    the current load PLUS the largest load in town, e.g. bore pump. 
  \item It takes about a minute to start another diesel up.
  \item Clouds take about 6-10 seconds to block the sun.
  \end{itemize}

  So what:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Since PWC know what the PWC plant is doing we can keep a big enough
  diesel running to allow for the clouds.
  \item But we don't know what a PV system on the roof is doing
  so the clouds might cause a blackout.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
